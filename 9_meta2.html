<p>When conducting meta-analysis, frequently we will encounter heterogeneity in the pooled measures of effect, and it is valuable to explore <em>possible factors that could explain this identified heterogeneity</em>. This can be accomplished through <strong>subgroup analysis and meta-regression</strong>. Additionally, we should explore possible indicators of <strong>publication bias</strong> or other <strong>small-study biases and effects</strong> in our meta-analysis datasets. Finally, often we will encounter complex data structures and issues when conducting meta-analysis, and we will explore different approaches that can be used to account for or address these complexities in our analysis.</p>

<h2 data-number="9.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="subgroup-analysis"><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Subgroup Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>Subgroup analysis</strong>, also known as moderator analysis, can be conducted to determine if specific study-related factors might explain some of the heterogeneity in our analysis. We essentially conduct one or more meta-analyses that are <em>stratified</em> by <strong>categorical variables</strong> of interest. Any such analyses should be pre-specified and identified in the review protocol. We should keep these analyses to a minimum, and focus on only those that are of most importance and have a strong rationale. For example, we may want to conduct a subgroup analysis to examine differences in pooled estimates across two or more variations of the intervention (or exposure), different control groups, study risk-of-bias ratings, study design, population characteristics (e.g., age group), or setting.</p>
<p>The process of subgroup analysis involves calculating a separate pooled measure of effect within each subgroup, then comparing the pooled estimates across groups with a statistical test. when comparing estimates across subgroups, an omnibus <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> test is used, which compares whether all subgroup pooled estimates are equal. We have the option of calculating <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span> separately within each group, or assuming a common estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span> that is applied for each subgroup (the latter is recommended if there are only 5 or fewer studies in a subgroup).</p>
<p>However, subgroup analyses have several limitations. They have low power to detect differences with small numbers of studies in each group, pooled estimates in each group will have lower precision, an absence of a detectable difference does not mean that the groups are equivalent, and any observed differences are only observational (and could be confounded by biases or other factors). At least <strong>10 studies</strong> are recommended if conducting a subgroup analysis.</p>
<p>To conduct subgroup analysis in <strong>R</strong>, we can specify the <code>subgroup</code> option with any of the meta-analysis functions in the <strong>meta package</strong>.</p>

Meta-regression models are mixed-effect regressions that have terms to account for the sampling error <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_j\)</span> and the between-study heterogeneity <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_j\)</span>, and one (or more) beta parameters representing our predictor variables of interest. For study <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, we can express such a model as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{\theta_j} = \mu + \beta{x}_j + \zeta_j + \epsilon_j
\]</span></p>
<p>A subgroup analysis is special case of this regression model, where we include a <em>categorical predictor</em> variable as our covariate <span class="math inline">\({x}_j\)</span>. When we evaluate <em>continuous predictors</em> (e.g., publication year), a <strong>weighted least squares</strong> approach is used to estimate the beta coefficient that best fits the data. In addition to estimating the effect of the predictor of interest, the model also calculates an <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value that represents the proportion of between-study variation that is explained by the predictor.</p>
<p>Similar to subgroup analysis, usually at least 10 studies are recommended to conduct meta-regression. Meta-regression has many of the same limitations as subgroup analysis. Additionally, one should not conduct analysis of a <em>predictor variables containing aggregated data from the studies</em> (e.g., mean age in each study), as this type of analysis can be affected by ecological bias.</p>
<p>In the <strong>R meta package</strong>, we can conduct meta-regression on our meta-analysis object (output) using the <code>metareg</code> function.</p>

<p>We can see in the results output that <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span>, representing the residual heterogeneity, is very high (&gt;96%). The test for residual heterogeneity also indicates there is still substantial heterogeneity present after accounting for publication year.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value is also only 1.7%, indicating the the publication year variable explain very little to no variability in effects across studies. The moderator test also indicates that this variable is not statistically significant (its 95% CI also crosses the null of no effect). If this variable was significant, we could say that for each additional year, the mean difference for a study is expected to increase by ~0.42 units.</p>
<p>We can also visualize the results of meta-regression analyses using a <strong>bubble plot</strong>.</p>

<h2 data-number="9.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publication-bias"><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Publication Bias</h2>
<p><strong>Publication bias</strong> is a major concern in systematic reviews. It refers to the probability that studies are more likely to be published, and specific outcomes and results in a study are more likely to be reported, if the findings are <em>statistically significant</em> or <em>confirm the hypothesis of interest</em>. Publication bias is one of several <strong>non-reporting biases</strong> that might be present in a systematic review. Others include citation bias, time-lag bias, multiple publication bias, language bias, and outcome reporting bias.</p>
<p><strong>Funnel plots</strong> can be used to visualize the possibility of publication bias in a meta-analysis. They are a scatter plot of the measures of effect of each included study against their standard error. If publication bias is not present, we would expect a <em>funnel</em> shape, with more precise (larger) studies clustering at the top and smaller, less precise studies scattered more widely at the bottom. Bias due to missing results presents as funnel plot <strong>asymmetry</strong>, where smaller studies without statistically significant results are missing on the bottom of the plot.</p>
<p>However, asymmetry can be due to a variety of <strong>small-study effects</strong>, not just publications bias (e.g., higher risk of bias in smaller studies, true heterogeneity, spurious relationships, or chance). For this reason, it is recommended to use <strong>contour-enhanced funnel plots</strong> that include shaded regions for statistical significance thresholds (e.g., P = 0.01, 0.05) to identify if the missing pattern is likely due to publication bias or other small-study effects. There are various <strong>statistical tests</strong> for funnel plot asymmetry to assess whether the associated between effect sizes and precision is greater than expected to occur by chance <span class="citation" data-cites="sterneRecommendationsExaminingInterpreting2011">(<a href="references.html#ref-sterneRecommendationsExaminingInterpreting2011" role="doc-biblioref">Sterne et al. 2011</a>)</span>. However, these tests have many limitations. For example, they should not be used whether there are less than 10 studies and when the studies all have a similar sample size. The performance and reliability on the tests on <em>observational studies</em> is also not well researched.</p>
<p>One such publication bias (small-study effects) test is <strong>Egger’s regression test</strong>. However, this test should only be used on continuous outcomes. In can be implemented in the <strong>R meta package</strong> using the <code>metabias</code> function and the <code>method.bias = "linreg"</code> option. For SMD outcomes, it is recommended to use alternative <code>method.bias = "Pustejovsky"</code> option when conducting the test, which uses a different method of calculating the SE in each study. This method requires specification of the sample size for each comparison group. For dichotomous outcomes, the <strong>Harbord test</strong> or <strong>Peters test</strong> can be used with <code>method.bias = "Harbord"</code> and <code>method.bias = "Peters"</code>, although there <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meta/meta.pdf">are other options as well</a>. Many of these tests may not perform optimally or reliably when heterogeneity is very high.</p>
<p>If publication bias or other small-study effects are suspected, there are various statistical methods that can be used to examine the <strong>influence</strong> of the bias on the pooled measure of effect. The most popular of these methods is called the <strong>trim and fill method</strong>. This method <em>imputes</em> “missing” studies until the funnel is symmetrical. The pooled effect calculated using this method is considered <strong>bias-corrected</strong>. This method is also not reliable when heterogeneity is high. There are <a href="https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/pub-bias.html#pub-bias-which-method">various other bias-adjustment methods available</a> but no consensus on which approach is best.</p>

<p>We can see most of the studies with greater precision have clustered at the top, with many in the statistically significant regions. At the bottom, there are a handful of smaller studies, with only one being in the very significant region. Based on this plot, there does not appear to be a strong indication of small-study biases, though if anything, we could be missing some medium-sized studies in the non-significant region. We will now conduct a <strong>Peters test</strong> for asymmetry.</p>

<p>In an earlier section <a href="6_extraction.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;6</span></a>, we introduced <strong>unit-of-analysis issues</strong>. This section will provide some additional details on how to address some of these issues using statistical techniques. We will examine how to adjust standard errors in <strong>clustered studies</strong> and studies that report <strong>more than one outcome of the same type</strong>. We will also examine different methods of combining <strong>multiple intervention/exposure comparison groups</strong>.</p>

<h3 data-number="9.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-trial-adjustments"><span class="header-section-number">9.4.1</span> Cluster Trial Adjustments</h3>
<p>Cluster trials can present an issue if an intervention is applied at the cluster level (e.g., school), but the outcomes are measured and reported on individual participants within the cluster (e.g., students) and the clustering is not accounted for in the analysis. In this case, the reported results can be adjusted for a <strong>design effect</strong> as per the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
DEFF = 1 + (M - 1)ICC
\]</span></p>
<p>In this formula, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> refers to the average cluster size in the study, and <span class="math inline">\(ICC\)</span> is the intra-class correlation coefficient. This value is rarely reported, so would need to be estimated from a similar study or other literature. The sample size in each group can then be divided by the design effect to obtain proper estimates. For dichotomous outcomes, both the number of events and sample size should be divided by this effect. Alternatively, the standard error of the measure of effect of the study can be multiplied by the square root fo the design effect.</p>

<p>If a study reports multiple outcomes of the same type, such that they would be included in the same meta-analysis, the outcomes would not be independent and this extra level of variation should be accounted for. This could be due to multiple sub-groups of populations in the same study (hierarchical clustering) or multiple measurements on the same participants in the same study (correlated effects). The most common approaches to address this are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Averaging of effects approach</strong>: in this method, we take a weighted average of the multiple similar outcomes within a study, to produce one estimate per study per meta-analysis. For correlated effects, this requires an estimate of the correlation between the two or more outcome measurements being combined.</li>
<li><strong>Three-level regression model</strong>: this method is appropriate for hierarchical clustering only, not correlated effects. It adds another random-effect for the outcomes being clustered within studies.</li>
<li><strong>Robust variance estimation</strong>: uses a special method of calculating the standard error that is consistent even when assumptions (e.g., independence of observations) are not met.</li>
<li><strong>Correlated and hierarchical effects models</strong>: use the robust variance approach along with multilevel modelling to account for both correlated and hierarchical effects in the same model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional reading on these approaches and how to implement them in <strong>R</strong> is available in the <a href="https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/multilevel-ma.html#multilevel-ma">Doing Meta-Anlaysis in R</a> online book. Note that these advanced methods may not be reliable when the number of studies included in the analysis is very small.</p>

<h3 data-number="9.4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multiple-comparison-groups"><span class="header-section-number">9.4.3</span> Multiple Comparison Groups</h3>
<p>If a study reports a comparison of two or more intervention (or exposure) groups to a control or comparison group, we need to avoid <em>double-counting</em> those outcomes in the analysis. For example, a study might report separate comparison data for different genders or age groups, or different variations (e.g., doses) of an intervention. There are different approaches to address this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pick the most relevant of the intervention/exposure groups</strong> and exclude the others. However, the decision of what is most relevant must be justified and this results in a loss of data.</li>
<li><strong>Split the sample size of the common control/comparison group</strong>: for example, if we had two variations of an intervention compared to a common control group with 200 participants, we would <em>split</em> the control group into two groups of size 100. However, this approach still results in the outcomes being correlated.</li>
<li><strong>Combine the two (or more) intervention/exposure groups</strong> into a weighted average. This is the preferred approach and is discussed and illustrated below.</li>
<li>If there are many studies with multiple comparison groups, consider a <a href="https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-11">network meta-analysis</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To combine two groups together, the sample sizes for the two groups can simply be added together. The means and SDs can be combined with the following formulas:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{{N_1}{Mean_1}+{N_2}{Mean_2}}{{N_1}+{N_2}}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{SD} = \sqrt\frac{{({N_1}-1){SD^2_1}+({N_2}-1){SD^2_2}+
\frac{{N_1}{N_2}}{{N_1}+{N_2}}}{({Mean^2_1}+{Mean^2_2}-2{Mean_1}{Mean_2})}}
{{N_1}+{N_2}-1}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thankfully, we can use an <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MathiasHarrer/dmetar/master/R/pool.groups.R"><em>R</em> function</a> to automate this calculation.</p>
