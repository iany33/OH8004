<p>This section will cover methods of <strong>combining measures of effect</strong> together to calculate an overall average or pooled meta-analysis estimate. When conducting a random-effects meta-analysis, it is important to quantify and explore the <strong>between-study heterogeneity</strong>, or differences in the effect sizes across studies that are due to study differences compared to sampling error. We display the results of a meta-analysis using a <strong>forest plot</strong> figure to facilitate interpretation and visualization of effects, variation, and study weights.</p>

<h2 data-number="8.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pooling-measures-of-effect"><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Pooling Measures of Effect</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter, we reviewed the basics of meta-analysis, including differences between fixed-effect and random-effects models. We will now cover procedures for <strong>conducting meta-analysis</strong> for different types of outcome data. All examples will use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meta/index.html"><strong>meta package</strong></a> in <em>R</em>.</p>
<p>The most common method of pooling measures of effect is called the <strong>generic inverse-variance</strong> method, the formula for which was provided in <a href="7_analysis.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;7</span></a>. In this method, studies are weighted by the inverse of their precision. This method is used for <strong>continuous data</strong> (e.g., mean difference, SMD), and can also be used for <strong>dichotomous data</strong>. It is also the method used when conducting meta-analysis on <strong>pre-calculated measures of effect</strong> (e.g., odds ratios, risk ratios).</p>

Change-From-Baseline Data
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Analyses of an intervention based on a change from baseline can be more efficient, increasing precision of estimates. They are ideally analyzed by including the baseline measurement as a covariate in a regression analysis or ANCOVA. In meta-analysis, change-from-baseline scores and post-intervention values can be combined in the same analysis if using a raw MD outcome. However, they should <strong>not</strong> be combined when using a SMD outcome, as <a href="https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-5-2">the standard deviations are not comparable</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When analyzing <strong>dichotomous raw data</strong> (e.g., number of events and sample size in each comparison group), there are alternative approaches available. The most common of these is the <strong>Mantel-Haenszel method</strong>. This method is <em>preferred</em> for dichotomous data, especially when the event is rare or when the sample size is small. The <strong>Peto odds ratio method</strong> is another approach, but it has more limitations and can only be used to calculate odds ratios.</p>
<p>One issue for dichotomous outcomes is that there may be <strong>zero events</strong> in one or both groups. In this case, the traditional, and often default approach in meta-analysis software, is to replace zero values with 0.5 (continuity correction). However, this correction is only required when using the generic inverse-variance approach; it should not be used when using the other methods.</p>
<p>In the <strong>meta package</strong>, the following functions can be used for meta-analysis of different types of data inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>metagen</code> for pre-calculated measures of effect</li>
<li><code>metacont</code> for continuous data</li>
<li><code>metabin</code> for dichotomous data</li>
<li><code>metaprop</code> for prevalence (proportion) data</li>
<li><code>metainc</code> for incidence rate ratio or incidence rate difference data</li>
<li><code>metarate</code> for incidence data in a single group</li>
<li><code>metacor</code> for correlation coefficients</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we will not cover meta-analysis of all of these data types. If interested to see examples of others, you can visit the online book <a href="https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/pooling-es.html#pooling-es-r">Doing Meta-Analysis in R</a>.</p>

Continuous Data Meta-Analysis Example
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>To illustrate how to conduct a meta-analysis using <strong>continuous data</strong>, we will examine part of the dataset from a systematic review of music interventions to improve various health outcomes in people with cancer <span class="citation" data-cites="bradtMusicInterventionsImproving2021">(<a href="references.html#ref-bradtMusicInterventionsImproving2021" role="doc-biblioref">Bradt et al. 2021</a>)</span>. Specifically, we will examine 17 studies from that review that evaluated music interventions plus standard care compared to standard care alone in adults to improve anxiety. Anxiety was measured in all studies using the Spielberger State Anxiety Index (STAI) scale, with lower scores representing lower anxiety.</p>

<p>We can see that each study reported the mean anxiety score, SD, and sample size in each comparison group. Because all studies measured the outcome on the same scale, we can calculate a raw mean difference (MD). For continuous data, we will use the <code>metacont</code> function.</p>

<p>Based on this analysis, we can see that the anxiety scores were lower among participants that received music interventions in addition to standard care vs.&nbsp;standard care alone.</p>
<p>If we wanted to change any settings, we can use the <code>update.meta</code> function to update our analysis. For example, we could run an updated analysis to compare how the results might change with a different method of calculating <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>.</p>

<p>As can been seen above, the dataset contains information from each study on the number of participants in each group that continued to abstain from smoking at 6+ months of follow-up. Also included is a column that specifies the type of treatment received. Since the data are dichotomous and all include raw data, we can calculate an measure of effect using the <strong>Mantel-Haenszel method</strong>. We will use the <code>metabin</code> function, but first we will subset our data to only conduct the meta-analysis on studies that investigated the <em>patch</em> as an intervention.</p>

<h3 data-number="8.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prevalence-and-incidence-data"><span class="header-section-number">8.1.1</span> Prevalence and Incidence Data</h3>
<p>Meta-analysis of <strong>prevalence and incidence data</strong> uses a slightly different approach than continuous and dichotomous data. The recommended approach for synthesizing such data is to use a <strong>generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM)</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="schwarzerSeriouslyMisleadingResults2019">(<a href="references.html#ref-schwarzerSeriouslyMisleadingResults2019" role="doc-biblioref">Schwarzer et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Prevalence data should be logit transformed prior to meta-analysis, while incidence data should be log transformed (this is done automatically in the <strong>meta package</strong>). For prevalence data, the GLMM approach fits an intercept-only logistic regression to the data, with a random-effect to account for the between-study variation. A Poisson GLMM model is used for incidence data.</p>
<p>Using the GLMM approach has some limitations. It is not possible to obtain individual study weights using this method. Additionally, there is only one method to calculate <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>, the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator, and there will be no confidence internals for <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>. In case those details are needed, the inverse-variance approach can be used with the arcsine or logit transformation for prevalence data, or the log transformation for incidence data.</p>

<h2 data-number="8.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assessing-heterogeneity"><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Assessing Heterogeneity</h2>
<p><strong>Heterogeneity</strong> refers to differences between studies that is beyond what we would expect from chance (or random error) alone. It can be due to differences in how interventions (exposures) and outcomes were defined, implemented, and measured, differences in the characteristics of the populations assessed, or other factors (e.g., differences in study methods, context, and bias).</p>
<p>There is a <span class="math inline">\(\chi2\)</span> statistical test for heterogeneity, called <strong>Cochran’s Q</strong>, that has been traditionally used and is included in the the <strong>R meta</strong> results output. This test evaluates whether this is more variation than would be expected by sampling error alone. However, this test has lower power when the number of studies is small. Additionally, its use is controversial, as some argue that since there are always differences expected between studies, some heterogeneity will always be present.</p>
<p>For this reason, the <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> statistic was developed to quantify heterogeneity <span class="citation" data-cites="higginsMeasuringInconsistencyMetaanalyses2003">(<a href="references.html#ref-higginsMeasuringInconsistencyMetaanalyses2003" role="doc-biblioref">J. P. T. Higgins et al. 2003</a>)</span>. The formula, based on Cochran’s <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, is shown below, with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> referring to the number of studies in the analysis:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I^2 = \frac{Q-(N-1)}{Q}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> refers to the percentage of variation in measures of effect across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error. While thresholds are often used in practice, these are discouraged. Instead, the amount of heterogeneity that is important depends on the content (e.g., magnitude and direction of effects, strength of evidence for heterogeneity). In general, <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> values of 0-40% might not be important, values of 75-100% usually indicate considerable heterogeneity, while values in 30-60% and 50-90% might indicate moderate to substantial heterogeneity <span class="citation" data-cites="higginsCochraneHandbookSystematic2022">(<a href="references.html#ref-higginsCochraneHandbookSystematic2022" role="doc-biblioref">J. Higgins et al. 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>However, because <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> is a relative measure, it should not be the only measure of heterogeneity reported. We can also examine <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> and its 95% CI, which represents the estimated SD of the true effects across studies (it is on the same scale as the measure of effect used in the analysis).</p>
<p><strong>Prediction intervals (PIs)</strong> are recommended to be included alongside other estimates of heterogeneity. A 95% PI estimates the range of values the measure of effect would be expected to fall within in 95% of similar studies that might be conducted in the future. In cases of heterogeneity, the PI covers a wider range of values than a CI. In <strong>R meta</strong>, we can add a PI to our output by adding the argument <code>prediction = TRUE</code> to the function input options.</p>
<p>We will explore in the next session <a href="9_meta2.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;9</span></a> how to investigate different causes of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis and meta-regression.</p>

Details on meta-analytical method:
- Inverse variance method
- Restricted maximum-likelihood estimator for tau^2
- Q-Profile method for confidence interval of tau^2 and tau
- Hartung-Knapp (HK) adjustment for random effects model (df = 16)
- Prediction interval based on t-distribution (df = 15)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can see in the results that the <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> test for heterogeneity is significant, and the <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span> value is also very high at ~93% (95% CI: 90.9-95.3%). While the pooled measure of effect (MD) has a 95% CI that excludes the null, suggesting a consistent positive effect of the music intervention, the PI crosses above zero. This indicates that we cannot rule out that the intervention might have no effect or a negative effect in future studies.</p>

</div>
<p>Examine and interpret the results.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many studies and unique outcomes were included?</li>
<li>What does the overall evidence say about the intervention?</li>
<li>How much heterogeneity is present? Is it significantly different than zero?</li>
<li>How does the result change if you use a different method of calculating <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a customized forest plot to visualize the results and include the prediction interval. How would you interpret the interval?</p>
<p>Now conduct a meta-analysis for the subset of <strong>non-randomized studies and the inspection scores outcome</strong>. Answer the same questions above for this analysis.</p>
